Summary:
Automating desktop trashcan using Servo and Ultrasonic range sensor, using Arduino Uno / Nano / Pro Mini as controller (also if using Arduino Pro Mini, can be stored inside servo box)Printed in multi parts to make easy to print and assemble, for the lever attach to the servo is using original parts fro the servo and then glued to the printed lever, detachable Bin to make easier to clean the bin.The system using lever to convert circular movement from servo to linear movement (actuator)The newest version, the ultrasonic range sensor box is attached on the upper support, equipped with cable management around the bin.Updated version:add new upper support with ultrasonic sensor box attached (with channel slot for cable management), include its bottom lit. This new parts makes ultrasonic sensors more reliableadd/update Bottom Support, widen the bar to make it more sturdyhttps://youtu.be/OuAOGftxxA4Source code of arduino: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LiE3b4c8ltQsWjGgDUUJ6Fft_rD7z3rC
